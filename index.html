            <h2>What are Google Fonts?</h2>
            <blockquote>“Google Fonts first launched in 2010 as an engineering initiative to move the web forward and make it faster.” — Google Design</blockquote>
            <p>Google Fonts launched in 2010, quickly becoming the Internet’s largest, free, open-source selection of fonts. All Google Fonts are free for commercial and personal use. The Google Fonts website makes it easy for anyone to quickly select and utilize different fonts for their own design needs.</p>

            <h2>Who creates the fonts?</h2>
            <p>Google Fonts collaborates with type designers, type foundries, and the design community all over the world. These people and organizations design the fonts that you see on Google Fonts. 
            For example, <a href="http://www.latofonts.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Łukasz Dziedzic</a> is an independent typeface designer who designed the popular typeface, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato" target="_blank" class="link font">Lato</a>.
            A typeface foundry named <a href="https://www.paratype.com/" target="_blank" class="link">ParaType</a> designed the typeface <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif" target="_blank" class="link font">PT Serif</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why should I consider using them?</h2>
            <p>You can’t beat free. Am I right? On top of being free, you should consider using Google Fonts on your next web design project because…</p>
